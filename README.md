# Python Projects Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts aimed at improving my Python programming skills by applying them to create basic games and perform various tasks. Each file in this repository represents a project that demonstrates specific concepts and techniques learned.

## Projects

1. **conver to dollar and cents**
   - A project that converts a given amount to dollars and cents.

2. **practice**
   - Placeholder or example project (add a description if necessary).

3. **guess the number game**
   - A simple guessing game where the player attempts to guess a randomly generated number.

4. **guess the number project**
   - Another variation of the guessing game project.

5. **independent work 1**
   - Project description needed (you can update this later).

8. **python ball game**
   - A basic game that involves controlling or simulating a ball using Python (e.g., with `pygame` or other libraries).

9. **resulting csv file project.py**
   - A script to process data and output the result in a CSV format.

10. **stopwatch**
   - A project that simulates a stopwatch, keeping track of time in a game or application.

## Notes
- This repository also contains `.ipynb_checkpoints`, which are auto-generated files when working with Jupyter notebooks. These files are ignored by Git using the `.gitignore` file.
